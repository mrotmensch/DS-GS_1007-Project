'''This program was created to help users identify public Wi-Fi locations that are closest to an address-of-interest.
To do so, the user provides an address in NYC, including all 5 boroughs. 
The program analyzes the address and presents the 5 nearest Wifi hot-spots to the user in table and map format. 
The table output includes the following information about the WiFi spot: Name, Location, Location Type, SSID, WiFi Type, and Distance. To help to user locate these hot-spots easily, a map is provided with markers to indicate both the address the user searched for (in blue), and the locations of the hot-spots (red) numbered in the same order as the table. To help the user better understand the distribution of WiFi spots in the city,
the program also produces and saves several figures displaying statistics about the free Wifi locations in NYC.'''
